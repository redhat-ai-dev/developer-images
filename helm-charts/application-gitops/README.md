# AI Software Template Helm Chart - Application GitOps Python Script
> [!WARNING]
> This image and its contents are deprecated and will no longer receive updates.

**NOTE**: This image built around this Python script is deprecated.  No replacement image is planned.  Instead a GitOps Bash script running from the OCP build image is used. 

The python script is responsible to create the application repository related with the deployment of the ai software template deployment. More details about the ai-software-templates helm chart can be found [here](https://github.com/redhat-ai-dev/ai-lab-helm-charts/blob/main/charts/ai-software-templates/chatbot/0.1.0/README.md).

The image is uploaded to `quay.io/redhat-ai-dev/helm-chart-application-gitops`

## Actions

The script performs the following actions:

1. Creates a repository with the given name and inside the given github organization.
2. Sets the default branch to the given one.
3. Populates the new repository with the contents of the ai software template and the tekton pipeline run.
